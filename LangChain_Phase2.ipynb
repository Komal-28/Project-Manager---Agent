      "System_Architect:\n",
      "### Proposed Architecture for the Food Delivery System\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Core Components\n",
      "1. **Client-Side (Frontend)**\n",
      "   - **Mobile App:** A responsive web application built using frameworks like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.\n",
      "   - **UI Components:** Menu display, cart management, payment interface, order tracking, ratings/reviews, and promotional notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Server-Side (Backend)**\n",
      "   - **API Layer:** RESTful or GraphQL APIs to handle requests from the mobile app.\n",
      "   - **Payment Gateway Integration:** A secure module for processing payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).\n",
      "   - **Real-Time Data Management:** Websockets or similar technology for order tracking updates.\n",
      "   - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user data, menu items, orders, payments, reviews, and promotional offers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **External Services**\n",
      "   - **Payment Processing Service:** Integration with third-party payment gateways.\n",
      "   - **Notification Service:** For sending promotional offers and order updates (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).\n",
      "   - **Analytics Service:** For tracking user interactions and application performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data Flow\n",
      "- **User Interaction:** Users interact with the mobile app to browse food items, place orders, and make payments.\n",
      "- **API Requests:** The app sends requests to the backend API to fetch menu data, submit orders, process payments, and retrieve order tracking information.\n",
      "- **Payment Processing:** Upon order submission, payment details are securely sent to the payment gateway, and a confirmation is received.\n",
      "- **Order Management:** Once the order is placed, the backend updates the order status and notifies the user via the app.\n",
      "- **Real-Time Tracking:** The app regularly fetches order updates through the API or listens for real-time updates via websockets.\n",
      "- **Feedback Collection:** Post-delivery, users can submit ratings and reviews, which are stored in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Risks or Bottlenecks\n",
      "1. **Payment Processing Delays:** Integration with payment gateways can often lead to delays due to compliance and security checks.\n",
      "2. **Real-Time Data Challenges:** Ensuring that real-time updates for order tracking are accurate and timely may require robust infrastructure and thorough testing.\n",
      "3. **Scalability Issues:** As user traffic increases, ensuring that the backend can handle multiple concurrent requests without performance degradation is crucial.\n",
      "4. **Dependency on Third-Party Services:** Relying on external services for payments and notifications may introduce risks if those services experience downtime.\n",
