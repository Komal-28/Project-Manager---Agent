      "#### **Sprint 6: Testing, Bug Fixing, and Deployment**\n",
      "- **User Stories:**\n",
      "  - As a user, I want the app to be reliable and free of bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tasks:**\n",
      "  - Conduct comprehensive unit testing and bug fixes for all features.\n",
      "  - Set up a cloud hosting environment and CI/CD pipeline for deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Timeline\n",
      "With each sprint lasting two weeks, the initial development phase can be completed within approximately 12 weeks (6 sprints). Post-launch, subsequent sprints can focus on iterative improvements and feature enhancements based on user feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Considerations\n",
      "- Collect user feedback to prioritize enhancements in future sprints.\n",
      "- Evaluate partnerships for integration with third-party tools (e.g., calendars, email services).\n",
      "- Plan for offline functionality and advanced filtering capabilities based on user demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This structured approach ensures that development efforts align with stakeholder expectations, providing a clear roadmap toward delivering a functional and user-friendly task management solution. The integration of CI/CD practices will facilitate efficient deployments and maintenance.\n",
